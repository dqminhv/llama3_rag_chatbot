**Hotel Reviews Chatbot**

This is a Gradio-based chatbot that allows users to query hotel reviews and displays a map of the hotel locations.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.8+
* Gradio 3.0+
* Folium 0.12+
* Geopy 2.2+
* Hugging Face Transformers 4.12+
* LLaMA Index 0.4+

**Usage**

1. Run the code in a Python environment with the required libraries installed.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Gradio.
3. Enter a query in the input box, such as "Which hotel had the best food?"

**Code Overview**

The code consists of several components:

1. **Data Loading**: The hotel review data is loaded from the Hugging Face dataset `ashraq/hotel-reviews`.
2. **Indexing**: The data is indexed using the LLaMA Index library, which allows for efficient querying of the data.
3. **Query Engine**: The query engine is built using the LLaMA Index library and allows users to query the data.
4. **Map Generation**: The map is generated using Folium, which displays the locations of the relevant hotels.
5. **Gradio Interface**: The Gradio interface is used to create a web-based interface for the chatbot.
